# Missions_to_Mars
Project Contributor - Julian Massiah

In this project, I built a website that runs on a local app. First, I built a simple HTML template for a Mars information website. This template has several display boxes for up to date information including a live twitter update of the weather on Mars from a science fact-based twitter handle, a daily featured photo of Mars from the NASA website, and Mars facts and photos. There are screenshots included of the finished product. 

I also developed an app to use in conjunction with the HTML template. I used Python to write the code for the app, and Flask to develop the local app to run the python code and extract up to date information from different websites. Once the app is started, it displays the extracted information within the HTML template.
